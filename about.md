MixedJames - a collection of articles and thoughts.

## Who am I?

I’m an NHS Junior Doctor.

Things I like:

- Medicine (believe it or not)
- Computers (especially the programming of them...)
  - From time to time I program in C++, Java, php, JavaScript, x86 assembly language, and, lately, R.
  - Making computers make pretty pictures on the screen is a particular interest
- Industrial heritage - particularly canals and railways
- Playing my guitar (although I don’t get to do much of that these days)
