   Cautionary tales: A Case of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis
---

Things are not always as they seem.

{:.disclaimer}

Important: cases presented here are based on real events. Sometimes they’re cases I’ve been involved with, sometimes not. I take great pains to ensure I’ve twisted the case enough to keep things anonymous. As they say, any resemblance to persons alive or dead is purely coincidental. The point is not to provide historical accuracy - the point it to tell a story that illustrates a practical medical point.

So...

A patient, let’s call him Bob, comes into A&E with worsening abdominal swelling and some discomfort. He’s a little confused. Things have been getting worse for a few days. The last day or so he’s been vomiting. Now Bob used to be a big drinker - he was diagnosed with cirrhosis a couple of years back but drinking was part of his life and he found it tough to stop. Now though he was teetotal. He’d been dry a whole seven months by the time he pitched up in A&E.

Bob’s in his late 40s and, other than the cirrhosis, he doesn’t have much else wrong with him. He doesn’t smoke, and he certainly doesn’t take any illicit substances. Examining him he doesn’t look well. He’s clearly jaundiced, but on a background of that grey, waxy skin that big drinkers get. He’s covered in stigmata of chronic liver disease. There’s a bit of vagueness rather than frank delirium but there’s also a bit of a flap. His tummy is tender all over but not clearly peritonitic and there’s obviously a lot of ascites.

The doctors who see him quite correctly recognise the pattern:

1. Decompensated alcohol-related liver disease with some encephalopathy
2. Possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Bloods are sent, antibiotics are started, a tap is done, etc. All well and good. Down he comes to the gastroenterology ward. They know Bob well. He’s a frequent flyer in outpatients - the diuretics aren’t working at keeping the ascites away and he needs regular drainage. Not good signs, but hey, you can’t transplant people who are still drinking, can you?

The usual rigmarole continues. The tap is back - it confirms peritonitis but they’re treating that so not much changes. Dieticians see Bob - nutrition is a big part of liver care. The physios and occupation therapists say “Hi” but rapidly decide that Bob’s doing ok mobility-wise and coping at home. All the while the medical treatment of antibiotics and albumin continue.

These patients are pretty dull for the ward doctors. As long as they slowly get better there isn’t much to do once the basics are in place. And Bob was getting better, sort of. It was slow going though. The low-grade fevers persisted. They drained his ascites on the second day. It reaccumulated surprisingly quickly - only 4 days later they were draining him again. This time the fluid was an odd pink colour - so odd that Bob’s daughter mentioned it to the nurses. No one seemed to have mentioned it to the doctors though. The drain had gone in late (some staffing issues had once again arisen) and because drains always come out 6-8 hours after they go in, by the time the doctors saw him the next morning, there was no evidence of what the fluid had looked like.

Then on day 5 the wheels begin to come off. The culture results for the ascitic fluid come back: at least two species have been isolated, and probably a third. One of juniors spotted this: “Isn’t more than one organism a bit suspicious in SBP? Don’t we usually consider bowel perforation?” This doctor hadn’t been there on the previous day but one of the others chipped in, “Oh, the boss has seen that - she wasn’t worried.” Another day passed.

Day 6: the next day the wheels that had been hanging on by the last nut, finally spun off into the bushes. The low grade fevers that the cautious observer would have noticed became great swinging fevers above 38 degrees Celcius. His heart rate became erratic and an ECG showed he had gone in atrial fibrillation - not a disaster in itself, but sign that something was afoot. And the abdominal pain was worse. The doctors went to see Bob first having been told he was unwell. The junior who spotted the culture chirped up: “Are we sure this isn’t secondary peritonitis? I mean that culture has got three organisms in it”

“What?!”, the alarmed consultant replied. She certainly didn’t know about the result. They had been medically managing a surgical emergency for nearly a week.

So, off Bob went for an urgent CT scan which inevitably showed perforation. Off went the junior doctors to summon the surgical team. But of course it was all in vane. The surgical team took one look at what had been happening and decided that it would be a nightmarish operation in a heavily contaminated abdomen and, given Bob’s physical state, his baseline liver failure, and the speed of his fluid accumulation there was no way they could operate and expect him to heal. He would just spend weeks on ICU with an abdominal would that wasn’t healing and sepsis that would come back every time they tried to wean the antibiotics. Bob died shortly after.

## What to make of it all?

I’m not sure I can point to one point for learning that would have changed this case. The reality is that Bob may well never have been fit for a laparotomy - the surgical mortality associated with Childs-Pugh grade C cirrhosis is enormous. However, that’s not really the point - the question is, how do we either (a) avoid missing secondary peritonitis or (b) diagnose it as close to admission as possible?

### Human factors

I suspect the first issue here was that secondary peritonitis just wasn’t on the doctors’ minds. Well, I’m sure the consultant considered it, but I’m not sure that (with one notable exception) the juniors even knew this was a possibility. Clearly some education might help.

Secondly, the assumption that the culture had been seen was unfortunate. I’m sure the consultant **had** seen the original result; unfortunately updates to the culture results appear on the same screen as the original and its not clearly marked that (or when) a result changes. There is a systems issue here which, when combined with juniors not appreciating the significance of the issue, escalated.

Thirdly, there was no automatic alert from the microbiology lab that this was an unexpected result. Given that many new microbiology results **do** generate a call from the lab I’m surprised that a polymicrobial culture from an ascitic tap didn’t generate a call.

As a matter of style I think the decision to do the second drain near to the end of a shift was probably poor. The patient wasn’t compromised by the volume of ascites. It could have waited.

### What is the scale of the problem?

I don’t have great numbers for this - admission to hospital with decompensated liver disease is undeniably common however. I would say every week our medical team will admit several. The British Society for Gastroenterology estimates that 15% of these admissions will have SBP. Of course we don’t know how many of these actually have secondary peritonitis. I’d say it’s a pretty small minority having done several gastro jobs and spent most of the last 6 years in front-door hospital medicine.

### What next...

I’m keen for these posts to be quick to write, otherwise I’m pretty sure I’ll never finish more than one or two so I’m not going to go into detail here. However, a quick literature search suggests a few avenues for exploration and some additional thoughts:

Runyon’s criteria

: Criteria for interpreting extended ascitic tap results. Apparently this is widely taught in some circles (though not in my text books it would seem). May not be terribly sensitive or specific.

Bed-side ultrasound for free air

: Free air is **not** expected in primary peritonitis. (Probably limited relevant in British practice as ultrasound skills are unusual in general medical practice. Formal departmental USS is not easier/quicker to access than a proper CT which is really the gold standard here)

Does Child-Pugh adequately assess operative risk in these patients?

: I suspect it underestimates risk - if it does, many of these patients will be almost certain to die in any event therefore does making a diagnosis of secondary peritonitis make any difference?
