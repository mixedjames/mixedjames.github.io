## TL;DR

- Cholestasis ≠ Biliary obstruction (Cholestasis = impaired biliary function due to **either** (a) impaired bile formation within the liver, or (b) physical obstruction of the biliary tree)
- Everyone knows a Ultrasound is a good first test **but**...
  - What next depends on clinical picture, biochemistry, and USS findings
  - USS shows: obstruction + stones → ERCP (good diagnostic test & will allow clearance of stones **but** high rates of complications)
  - USS shows: obstruction + no stones → CT (we're probably looking for cancer)
