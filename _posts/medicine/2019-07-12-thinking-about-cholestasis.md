Some clinical nuggets to help in thinking about patients with deranged liver function tests in the so-called “obstructive” pattern.

# A motivating example...

A patient goes to their GP feeling tired all the time. A classic GP case. Their enterprising GP does a set of bloods - he's concerned about the results and sends them to my Ambulatory Emergency Care department. The bloods in question were mostly fine but the LFTs looked like this...

| Analyte                        | Result                       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Bilirubin                      | 40μmol/L (normal < 17μmol/L) |
| Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) | 100 (normal < 56 IU/L)       |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)     | 350 (normal < 20-140 IU/L)   |

How do we localise the issue? I assume that you can recognise these abnormalities as so-called “obstructive” liver function tests.

Well, this isn’t going to be an all-encompassing tutorial on liver disease. Instead I want to focus on some clinical nuggets and concepts that I didn’t get until I started clinical practice.

# Cholestasis ≠ Biliary obstruction

| Term                | Definition                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cholestasis         | Biochemical evidence of impaired bile flow.                  |
| Biliary obstruction | Physical obstruction to the biliary tree. Usually evidenced by imaging showing dilated ducts. |
