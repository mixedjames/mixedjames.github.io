title: Thoughts on differentiating SBP and secondary peritonitis

In the patient with ascites and tummy pain it’s tricky to tell Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis apart from Secondary bacterial peritonitis (i.e. organ perforation). I’ve previously written about a case where we discovered this challenges. I wanted to document a few thoughts I had about how I might approach the diagnosis in the future.

## Runyon’s Criteria

Runyon’s Criteria[^Runyon] have been around since 1990. They basically say that secondary peritonitis should be considered in the following situations:

| Situation                                                    | Implication                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ascites visible bile-stained<br />OR<br />Ascites bilirubin >6mg/dL<br />OR<br />ascitices:serum bilirubin >1.0 | Consider secondary peritonitis from ***biliary perforation*** |
| Initial tap shows at least 2 of:<br />a) Total protein >1g/dL<br />b) Glucose <50mg/dL<br />c) LDH > serum upper limit of normal | Consider secondary peritonitis due to ***perforated viscus*** |
| Repeat tap at 48hrs:<br />a) Polymorphic neutrophil count not returned to baseline | Consider secondary peritonitis due to ***focal abscess***    |

In reality this means that if any one of the above criteria is met, the patient should get imaging (probably a CT scan) to look for secondary peritonitis.

### Criticisms of Runyon’s criteria

PulmCrit[^PulmCrit] had written an article about secondary peritonitis and criticises Runyon’s criteria for a few things:

1. The test performance when re-evaluated in 2010 by Soriano et al. was not as good as we thought it was originally (give a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 90%)
2. Diagnosis of non-perforated secondary peritonitis requires a 48 hour delay following commencement of treatment

### How well can we expect Runyon’s criteria to perform?

The performance of Runyon’s criteria has been evaluated by a few different authors:

| Author                              | Sensitivity                             | Specificity                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Akriviadis & Runyon (1990)[^Runyon] | 100% (for perf)<br />66% (for non-perf) | 45% (for perf)<br />100% (for non-perf) |
| Soriano et al. (2010)[^Soriano]     | 67%                                     | 90%                                     |
